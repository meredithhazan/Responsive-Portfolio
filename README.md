# Responsive-Portfolio
Using media queries to create responsive web design

Updated a previously-created portfolio with a mobile-responsive layout using three @media screen tags, each with one of these max-widths: 980px, 768px and 640px.

Made the layout match the following screenshots:

* 980px
![980px home](/assets/images/980-index.jpg)
![980px contact](/assets/images/980-contact.jpg)

* 768px
![768px home](/assets/images/768-index.jpg)
